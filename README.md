# QUICK n RANDOM
a quick loading random music player without mp3 tag playlists  

most music players waste time to read mp3 tags of all files and make playlists even for random play. QUICK n RANDOM doesn't do that. it handles only a file list in the default music folder for random play but you can also choose a song in the list box.

the icon, bass.dll, id3 libraries and lame.exe are each under license of [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), [un4seen developments](http://www.un4seen.com/), [3delite's](https://www.3delite.hu/) and [the lame project](https://lame.sourceforge.io/) for non-commercial use only.  

bass.pas, BufferedStream.pas, ID3v1Library.pas, ID3v2Library.pas, uTExtendedX87.pas path should be modified.  
bass.dll and lame.exe should be with the executable file in the same folder.  

QUICK n RANDOM works on windows 64bit.
